**Instagrammable**

Our project, titled Instagrammable, answers the question of: Is your photo “Instagram Worthy”? Instagrammable helps users decide if their photos are high quality and eye catching, and if they are worthy of being posted to social media. It evaluates photos and assigns them an aesthetic score from 0-5, first using CLIP to extract vector embedding features and then models like Linear Regression, SVM, and more in an ensemble learning approach for prediction/scoring. It also provides an explanation as to why the photo is a good/bad photo for the user to post using the image's CLIP embedding and a preset bank of various photography/rating terms to match them to the image. The explanation is centered around the aesthetic quality of the photo, the angles, the lighting, and other aspects of the photo. Overall, Instagrammable helps users maximize engagement, makes their social media feeds more visually appealing, and helps users choose the best images to post with in-depth feedback.
